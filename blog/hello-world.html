<h4>November 16, 2020</h4>
<p>So, I wanted to have my own blog for several years. Don't know why I kept delaying it. Finaly, I purchased a domain, and published this blog with github pages.</p>
<h2>Github Pages</h2>
<p>I've been using github pages for more than two years now. They have awesome integration with jekyll. But jekyll seemed overkill for my intention. Besides, I like writing my own scripts(or at least understanding what I'm copying ðŸ˜‰).</p>
<h2>Finaly</h2>
<p>Okay, I finaly have my very own place to write. I'll style it slowly. Coded this whole thing very fast(donno why tho) ðŸ˜¶</p>
