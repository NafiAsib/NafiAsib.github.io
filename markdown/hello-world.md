# Hello World
#### November 16, 2020

So, I wanted to have my own blog for several years. Don't know why I kept delaying it. Finaly, I purchased a domain, and published this blog with github pages.

## Github Pages
I've been using github pages for more than two years now. They have awesome integration with jekyll. But jekyll seemed overkill for my intention. Besides, I like writing my own scripts(or at least understanding what I'm copying ðŸ˜‰).

## Finaly
Okay, I finaly have my very own place to write. I'll style it slowly. Coded this whole thing very fast(donno why tho) ðŸ˜¶
